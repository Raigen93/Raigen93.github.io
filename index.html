    <h3>A little bit about me:</h3>

    <p>

      I have spent the last 8 years welding, working with my hands. While I enjoyed my time in the welding world,
      I feel it is time for me to move on to something that will better enable me to provide for my family. My fianc√© and I
    have three children together, eight-year-old twin boys (Blake and Brayden), and our three-year-old girl Addison.
