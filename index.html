  <h2>
    Hello world! My name is Alec J Griffiths, and this is my first project with HTML and CSS.
  </h2>

    <ul>Some of my goals are:
      <li>Learn to become a Full Stack Developer.</li>
      <li>Build a portfolio.</li>
      <li>Find a better job, so I can take care of my family.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>A little bit about me:</h3>
  <p>
      I have spent the last 8 years welding, working with my hands. While I enjoyed my time in the welding world,
      I feel it is time for me to move on to something that will better enable me to provide for my family. My fianc√© and I
    have three children together, eight-year-old twin boys (Blake and Brayden), and our three-year-old girl Addison.
